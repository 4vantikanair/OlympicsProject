# OlympicsProject

This is a project revolving around the history of all the athletes participating in the Olympics from 1896 to 2016. Using Pandas and Seaborn in Python, the project explores the 
the various attributes gold medalists have and the relationships between them. Towards the end, this information is taken to create a classification tree model using 
machine learning to visualize what attributes result in an increased chance of winning a gold medal.

More details on the project and my thought process when doing it is outlined within the project code -- specifically in Olympics Jupyter Notebook.

This project is still in the works as I am a firm believer that there is always room to improve and make code better. If there are suggestions like how to make the EDA more focused, how to make the model more accurate, or anything else, please don't hesistate to inform me.
